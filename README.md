# Deeper Caves Patched
#### This is a patched [Deeper Caves](https://github.com/Valiec/DeeperCaves/tree/master) mod by [Valiec](https://github.com/Valiec)

### What's changed?


## Fixes:

1. Fixed a rare crash (`java.lang.StackOverflowError: Exception while updating neighbours`) that occurs when entering Drop, which is related to water physics. The fix is to reduce the flowing water as much as possible (regular lakes remain)

2. Fixed a crash (`java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: bound must be positive`) that occurs when trying to break some ores from the mod

## Other changes:

#### Achievements have been removed due to the fact that they could not be obtained, and they were left unfinished anyway.

#### Various changes in .lang, mainly ru_RU.lang

#### Minor code optimization in general
